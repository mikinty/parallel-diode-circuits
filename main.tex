\begin{abstract}
  We present a set of solutions to sorting numbers and finding all shortest paths in a directed, weighted graph, by using diodes, instead of traditional Turing computational model methods.
  We see that the solutions are able to produce good time complexity results,
  derive a solution for $O(n)$ time and space for sorting $n$ numbers and $O(\abs{V}^2)$ time and $O(\abs{V} + \abs{E})$ space for finding the shortest path between all pairs of vertices in a graph.
  However, the cost of producing diodes with large weights is potentially an exponentially expensive resource relative to input sizes, which may lend to why we are able to solve problems so quickly.

\section{Introduction}

Most computer science algorithms rely on the Turing Machine model of computation (\cite{turing1936computable}), where we encode information with bits, and we can read or write information in some sort of memory.
For practical purposes, we use Von Neumann architectures for computers (\cite{von_nuemann_architecture}), which use instruction sets to tell CPUs how to manipulate data in order to solve problems.
While these methods have proven empirically to be able to solve a vast variety of problems relatively efficiently, there is a question of ``are current computation methods the fastest way to represent and solve our problem?''

The idea for this paper is that we present a more naturally-motivated way to represent problems, in our case sorting and shortest path, with diodes, and see how we can solve them more quickly than with traditional Turing Machine style computation.

\section{Real-Life Implementations of Circuits}
\label{sec:real_life}

To demonstrate that these ideas can work in practice, I built these circuits
in real life and tested them out.

I only tested small graphs and weights, meaning my $\Vmax \leq \SI{10}{\volt}$ in all cases.

I tested correctness of my algorithm on a sorting problem with $n=5$, and on a graph with $6$ nodes\footnote{I would really want to post videos of these circuits, but I no longer have them, and would like some funding before attempting to build larger scale circuits}.

For further research, I should compare the efficiency of my circuits to library functions.
Since I am using breadboard circuits and hobby-shop components, it may be hard to produce a fair comparison to the very-optimized layout of a CPU, but nonetheless, it would be interesting to see the asymptotic behavior of the algorithm to see if the above analysis are actually correct.
Furthermore, it's quite cumbersome to have to create new circuit topologies for every variation of a problem, so there is definitely improvement on building some sort of circuit layout that maybe more generalizable and modular to support a variety of sorting or graph problems easily.

\section{Discussion}

The biggest question regarding the practicality of the circuits in this paper are about the diodes and physical properties.

\begin{question}
  Do real diodes behave close enough to ideal for the results in this paper to hold?
\end{question}

Although in Section \ref{sec:real_life} I wasn't able to provide a lot of evidence, especially for larger scales, the exponential $I-V$ curve for diodes likely makes the properties in this paper good enough to hold in real life.
The only adjustment is that because a diode is no longer exactly ``off'' anymore before reaching $V_D$, meaning the diode will probably still allow some current through, instead of measuring $I(A_i) < 0$ to determine if a certain diode is on or not, we may instead have to check $I(A_i) < \epsilon$, but this is not a big deal.

\begin{question}
  How do we get diodes of arbitrary threshold voltage?
\end{question}

This is probably the biggest issue with the circuit design in this paper. While I wasn't able to find much about very large turn-on voltage diodes, as it's unlikely anybody would ever need a $\SI{100000}{\volt}$ diode, we are likely to believe that a diode with $\VD$ will likely require $O(\VD)$ resources to construct.
However, if this is not the case, then the circuits in this paper have some profound implications.

\begin{question}
  What are some of the physical limitations of these circuits, with regard to electrical signal and the speed of light?
\end{question}

Physical limitations include how the electrons travel through wires and in the circuit.
We have been modeling electron travel through wire as instantaneous, which technically
isn't true by physics, since the electrons will move in the wire at the speed
of light. Because we have finite speed, we should consider the size of the
circuits being built, as they can have an asymptotic complexity effect on
their computational efficiency. However, even with this consideration, we can see that our circuits are all no bigger than the input size, so our time and space complexities are unaffected, even with this electron speed limitation.

\subsection{Other Problems to Consider}

While I have presented 2 natural problems to solve with these diodes, we beg the question of what other problems can we solve with this superparallel diode comparison idea?

There are some properties of the superparallel comparison that give some interesting properties. For example, if we had a complete binary tree with weights on their edges, and we wanted to know the shortest path from the root to any leaf node, it would normally be a very difficult problem to do with traditional computation, but with superparallel comparison, we can just apply $\Vmax$ to the root and attach all the leaf nodes together, and be able to find that shortest path among $2^n$ very fast.
Obviously there are the costs of translating the input into the diode way of representing the problem, but the fast comparison seems to at least lessen the burden of comparing many numerical quantities to each other one by one.

Maybe we only really are able to gain time efficiencies on the order of $O(\log n), O(n)$, but depending on the application, that could be a very significant improvement.
