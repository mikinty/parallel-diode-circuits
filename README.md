# Fast Sorting and Shortest Path Algorithms with Diode Circuits

We present a set of solutions to sorting numbers and finding all shortest paths in a directed, weighted graph, by using diodes, instead of traditional Turing computational model methods.
We see that the solutions are able to produce good time complexity results,
derive a solution for $O(n)$ time and space for sorting $n$ numbers and $O(|V|^2)$ time and $O(|V| + |E|)$ space for finding the shortest path between all pairs of vertices in a graph.
However, the cost of producing diodes with large weights is potentially an exponentially expensive resource relative to input sizes, which may lend to why we are able to solve problems so quickly.

## TODO

- Think about if ray tracing is possible to do faster
- Or another problem where it is "intuitive" to use a different circuit topology
